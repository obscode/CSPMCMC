# Extinction Estimates based on SNIa Colors

The code in this folder implements the methods outlined in  
[Burns et al. 2014](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...789...32B).
It uses data obtained by fitting SNIa light curves, resulting in 
magnitudes in each filter at maximum, and a measure of the light-curve (LC)
width (stretch, dm15, x1, etc) for each SN. The code then uses these
magnitudes and LC widths to determine intrinsic colors and extinction
properties for the sample.

## Data Format
The input data is the same as the other two codes (Tripp_H0 and Ext_H0) to
keep things simple. Each line in the data file represents a single SN and filter
combination and each field should be white-space delimited. The fields are:

1. SN name (string, no white space)
2. Heliocentric redshift (not used for this code) (float)
3. CMB-frame redshift (not used for this code) (float)
4. filter (string)
5. LC width (float)
6. error in LC width (float)
7. magnitude at maximum, K-corrected to rest frame and corrected for MW
   extintion (float)
8. Error in magnitude at maximum
9. phase of first observation (not currently used) (float)
10. E(B-V) from Milky-Way (not currently used) (float)
11. error in MW E(B-V) (not currently used) (float)
12. covariance between magnitude at maximum and LC width (float)
13. Host galaxy name (not used for this code)
14. Source of photometry (not used for this code) (string)

The data can be split up over multiple files.

The code can be run simply by specifying a configuration file. An example 
(`example.cfg`) is provided here.  The configuration controls key parameters 
of the fitting procedure and model (see comments). The code is then run as
follows:
  
  `python EBV_stan.py example.cfg`

If you want to modify the code to work on another data-set, you can easily do 
so by editing get_data.py. The comments therein describe how the data need to
be prepared to send to the STAN code.

There is a post-run script, `plot_EBV.py` that should be run to examine the
results and produce a table of extinctions that will be needed for the
`Ext_H0` code. Run this in the same way:

  `python plot_EBV.py extample.cfg`

There are two more scripts, `run_stan_job.py` and `run_stan_job_slurm.py` that
can be used to submit jobs to PBS and SLURM queue managers, respectively. Make
a working folder somewhere and put a configuration file there.  Run either
script from this folder, specifying the path to the configuration file. The
scripts will take care of generating submit scripts and submitting them to the
job scheduler. The submit scripts will also copy over all the needed files to
the working folder.
